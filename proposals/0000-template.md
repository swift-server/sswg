## Introduction

A short explanation as to what is hoping to be accomplished with the proposed package. Try to keep it to a
single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what
problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

Describe the reasoning for this package to be proposed to the Swift Server Working Group to be recommended for use across the Swift Server ecosystem.

If there are missing capabilities or flexibility with existing packages, outline them with clear examples.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it's a new API, show the full API and its documentation
comments detailing what it does. The detail in this section should be
sufficient for someone who is *not* one of the authors to be able to
reasonably re-implement the feature.

## Maturity Justification

Explain why this solution should be accepted at the proposed maturity level.

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and
why you chose this approach instead.
